<h1>About</h1>
Following along a YouTube video, I was able to create my first mySql project.
By working from an existing data, I clean the data to use only the Sales table. 
I added some columns time_of_day, day_name, and month_name in addition to the Sales table.  
It's a good sample to learn about data querying and aggregation. As well as, having to answer
some common business questions.
